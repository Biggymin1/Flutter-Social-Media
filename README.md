## Getting Started

video preview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF1LZkwebsM

The app frontend was fully made using flutter

Notes:
Some of the features were not shown in this video due to a bug where the page won't refresh when receiving new data

All of the system such as adding project to saved, followers system, stories system were working perfectly in the backend but we're not finished in the front end

The colored button in the main page is 3 different algorithm for recommending the best post to the user

List of features:
1) Stories
2) Followers System
3) Posting
4) Recommendation Algorithm

More feature such as virtual high comparison might be available in the future

Ps: this is my first web project don't be to harsh please lol
